 <h2>The best way to get to know me outside of work is to ask me about my hobbies!</h2>
 <h3>Tennis</h3>
 <p1>I enjoy some casual tennis play when I can. I think the best time to play is in the fall when it gets nice and cool after work. It's a great way to be active and keep your blood pumping. Plus it's a bit strategic so it works the mind as well. It's also fun to watch, I particularly have my eyes on Coco Gauff, the current US Open Women's Champion.</p>
  <h3>Cosplay</h3>
  <p1>You're looking at the 2022 Dreamcon cosplay contest winner here! I've been cosplaying since my early days, yes I count Halloween in that category. I didn't get serious about going to cons and doing it until 2013 and have been going consecutively since 2019. Checkout the winning cosplay though. </p1>

  <h3>Knitting</h3>
  <p1>Want a great way to pass the time? Give knitting a try. It's fairly easy to learn, most patterns call for 2 types of stitches and it's very begginer friendly. Between knitting and crochet, I'll always pick the former.</p1>
